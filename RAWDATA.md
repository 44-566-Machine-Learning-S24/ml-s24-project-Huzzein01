Here’s how I approached cleaning the traffic data from Kaggle using Tableau, which allowed for a thorough and visually interactive preparation process:

Data Importation:
I started by connecting Tableau to the dataset, which was in CSV format. This allowed me to view the preliminary data structure and identify the key columns that would be involved in the analysis.

Initial Data Inspection:
In the Data Source tab, I inspected the dataset visually to identify any apparent inconsistencies, missing values, and any outliers that might skew the analysis.

Handling Missing Values:
I noticed some missing values in key columns like 'CarCount' and 'BusCount'. Using Tableau’s built-in features, I filtered out these missing values, considering that imputing them might introduce bias given the nature of traffic data which can be highly variable.

Splitting Columns:
The 'Time' column included both date and time information. I used Tableau’s split function to divide this into two separate columns, 'Date' and 'Time', to simplify further analysis.

Adjusting Data Types:
I ensured that all columns were categorized by their correct data type. For example, I changed the 'Date' column to a date type and numerical columns like 'CarCount' were confirmed as integers.

Creating Calculated Fields:
To enrich the dataset, I created several calculated fields. For instance, I calculated 'Total Traffic' by summing 'CarCount', 'BikeCount', 'BusCount', and 'TruckCount'. Another calculated field was 'Traffic Situation', categorizing traffic volume into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' based on thresholds I defined.

Filtering Irrelevant Data:
I applied filters to exclude data from non-peak hours, focusing the analysis on times more likely to experience congestion.
Aggregating Data:

Considering the dataset was very detailed, I aggregated the data at a daily level to observe broader trends rather than hourly fluctuations. This involved grouping by 'Date' and summing up the counts of different vehicle types.
Data Validation:

After cleaning, I created several visualizations directly in Tableau to validate that the data behaved as expected. For example, plotting daily traffic volume helped confirm that the cleaning steps had been effectively implemented.
By following these steps, I ensured that the dataset was not only clean but also structured in a way that would facilitate insightful analysis and reliable predictions regarding traffic patterns.
