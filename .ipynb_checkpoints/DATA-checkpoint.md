Overview
This section provides a detailed exploration of the Kaggle traffic dataset used in our analysis. The data contains various metrics on traffic volumes, including counts of different types of vehicles (cars, bikes, buses, trucks) and comprehensive timestamps of when these counts were recorded.

Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

Time: The specific time when traffic data was recorded.
Date: The date on which the data was collected.
Day of the Week: The day of the week.
CarCount: Number of cars observed.
BikeCount: Number of bikes observed.
BusCount: Number of buses observed.
TruckCount: Number of trucks observed.
Total: Total number of vehicles observed.
Traffic Situation: Categorical data indicating the traffic condition (e.g., normal, heavy).
Data Transformations
Several transformations were applied to enhance the data's usability for analysis:

Timestamp Splitting: The 'Time' column was originally a datetime type. It was split into two separate columns, 'Hour' and 'Minute', to simplify time-based analysis.
Categorical Encoding: The 'Day of the Week' and 'Traffic Situation' were encoded into numerical values to facilitate their use in various machine learning models.
Missing Data Handling: Any missing values in vehicle counts were filled using median values of the respective columns to maintain the data integrity without introducing significant bias.
Visual Explorations
Here are some key visualizations created during the exploratory data analysis phase:

Hourly Traffic Trends: A line graph showing the average vehicle counts across different hours of the day, highlighting peak traffic times.
Day-wise Traffic Distribution: A bar chart depicting the average traffic volume per day of the week, identifying weekdays with higher traffic volumes.
Vehicle Type Analysis: Pie charts and histograms that show the distribution of different types of vehicles and their contributions to total traffic.
