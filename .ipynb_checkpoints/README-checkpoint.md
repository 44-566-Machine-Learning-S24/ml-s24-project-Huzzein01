# Traffic Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze traffic data collected at various time intervals to understand traffic patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables. The project includes exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling using machine learning techniques, and evaluation of model performance.

## Notebooks

### 1. data_exploration.ipynb
- This notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the traffic dataset.
- Important findings from the EDA include:
  - Identification of peak traffic hours during weekdays.
  - Analysis of traffic patterns across different days of the week.
  - Examination of correlations between various features such as vehicle counts and total traffic volume.

### 2. linear_regression.ipynb
- Initial Data Prep Section:
  - Reads and cleans the dataset.
  - Creates training and testing sets.
- Linear Regression:
  - Performs linear regression on the selected features and target variable.
  - Computes metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
- Comments on Results:
  - Discusses the performance of the initial linear regression model and potential areas for improvement.

### 3. additional_analysis.ipynb
- Investigates additional features or models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explores feature engineering, feature selection, or alternative machine learning algorithms.
- Final Evaluation with Test Set:
  - Evaluates the final model's performance on the test set.
  
### 4. README.md
- Overview of the project.
- Comments on each notebook and important results.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project provides insights into traffic dynamics and explores predictive modeling techniques to forecast traffic volume. By analyzing traffic data and building predictive models, the project aims to contribute to transportation planning and management efforts.
